<h1>Why was i just killed when connecting to ChatSpike?</h1>
<br>
To combat the rising tide of virus drones trying to connect to our network, I, [Brain], have
written a script which will check your details when you connect. It works by awarding points
for things in your details that look like a virus drone's nick, ident and fullname fields.
<br>
To be killed by the service, your score must be above 7. Anything else, and the score will
just be logged and you will be allowed to go on your way.
<br><br>
<b>To avoid being killed in the future here is a list of scoring systems used by the script so
that you may adjust your details to get onto the network.</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li> Nick contains a known dictionary word or human name, -3 points per word
<li> When symbols are removed, nick contains a dictionary word or human name, -3 points per word
<li> Ident contains a known dictionary word or human name, -3 points per word
<li> When symbols are removed, Ident contains a dictionary word or human name, -3 points per word
<li> Full name contains a known dictionary word or human name, -3 points per word
<li> Full name is under 5 characters, +1 point
<li> When symbols are removed, fullname contains a dictionary word or human name, -3 points per word
<li> Nickname starts with what appears to be an alliance/clan tag (e.g. [ABC]), -2 points
<li> Nick is the same as ident, -3 points
<li> Nick is the same as fullname, -3 points
<li> Fullname is the same as ident, -3 points
<li> Nick is only one character in length, +1 point
<li> Nick is under 6 characters in length, +1 point
<li> Nick is under 3 characters in length, +1 point
<li> Ident is over 9 characters in length, +1 point
<li> Ident contains numbers, -3 points per number
<li> Fullname contains numbers, -3 points per number
<li> Fullname is under 13 characters, +1 point
<li> Ident contains a full stop, hyphen or underscore, -2 points per symbol
<li> Fullname contains spaces, -1 point per space
<li> Fullname has colour codes, -1 point per colour code
<li> Fullname has symbols, e.g. $, !, ?. -3 points per symbol
<li> Fullname ends with .com, .net, or .org, +5 points
<li> Fullname starts with "sympatico.", "hotmail.", "mail.", or "microsoft.", +4 points
<li> Nick contains {, }, |, `, ^, ], [, _, \. +1 point per symbol
<li> Nickname is over 50% symbols shown in rule 17, +1 point
<li> Nick contains numbers, -1 point per number
<li> Fullname is all letters with no spaces or symbols, +2 point
<li> Ident is all letters, no symbols. +1 point
<li> Nickname contains NO numbers, +1 point
</ul>

A reminder again that HIGH scores are BAD, the <i>average score scored by a ChatSpike user</i> is around <b>0</b> (when all weighting balances out to give the final score).
