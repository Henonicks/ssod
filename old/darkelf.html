font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>ong ago, several races of
Cryptillia gathered together to form what is known as the 'Peace Pact'. This
huge gathering of leaders from many races, including the Human Empire, the Elf
Tribes and the Dwarves, was supposed to usher in a new era of peace on the
planet. However, a corruption found its way into the meeting, and as the many
great vessels of peace set out across the Great Sea to reach the neutral lands
chosen for the meeting where the pact would be signed, and great magical
energies would bind it, dark forces intervened, and several of the ships missed
the all-important meeting upon the shores of that island. Storms, strange
monsters and other phenomena swept whole armadas off course, never to arrive.
One of these such armadas was a whole elven tribe, which over time, without the
magical protection of the Peace Pact, came to hate all it stood for and began to
work against it, subverting the very magic that holds a fragile peace in
Cryptillia today. These elves soon became known as the 'Dark Elves'. They are
untrustworthy and hateful of outsiders, and they would rather stab somebody in
the back than negotiate openly, blending silently into the shadows to observe
the world without being noticed.<o:p></o:p></span></font></h1>
