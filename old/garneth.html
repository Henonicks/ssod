most dangerous advisory in the land of Utopia, if not all of Cryptillia at the
current time. Garneth was once a powerful lord, ruling a large section of south
utopia. Unfortunately, the Lord Garneth became corrupted by the forces of evil.
The real reason for his corruption has never been determined, however it is
commonly believed to have been his lust for power and a desire to claim more
land for himself. Over time, the demon lord has become more powerful,
barricading himself in his castle and not permitting anyone to leave alive -
Eventually people learned to stay clear of his accursed area. The Lord Garneth
has not been seen by anyone alive since the time of his possession, some fifty
years ago, as he will never leave the castle. However, his minions are always to
be seen terrorising the immediate area, reaching as far as the Larret bridge in
the north, and as far as Port Obligan to the south. To this date, there has been
no-one courageous enough to confront Garneth and end his reign of terror once
and for all...</span></font></h1>
