Hallucinogen, a potent herb thriving in the wild and untamed corners of Cryptillia, holds the power to alter perceptions for those who partake in its essence. Recognizable by its vibrant, multicolored blooms, Hallucinogen is sought after by shamans and illusionists for its hallucinatory properties. When integrated into spells, Hallucinogen induces a temporary divergence from reality, causing those within its influence to experience vivid and distorted visions. It is wielded by spellcasters seeking to disorient adversaries or explore altered states of consciousness.
