Hartleaf, a delicate herb thriving in the fertile soils of Cryptillia, is entwined with the essence of movement and water. Its slender stems, adorned with heart-shaped leaves, shimmer with a subtle aquatic glow. When harvested under the silver light of a crescent moon, the herb's potency is said to reach its zenith. Wizards and spellcasters prize Hartleaf for its association with fluidity and swiftness, often employing it as a key component in spells invoking agile movements or manipulating the currents of water.
