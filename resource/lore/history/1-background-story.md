It is not often that an adventurer such as yourself is summoned to the Wizard’s Keep, especially at such short notice. You have received urgent news from a close friend in the keep, informing you that they need people such as yourself to protect the place. It is obvious some kind of delivery has taken place, obviously the items being moved have significant value.

It is mid-summer, but the whole area is embroiled in a snowstorm. Snow and ice are whipped up into sheets that roll across the view outside your window, descending from the Deathdrop Mountains some distance away, snaking about the buttresses of the keep like the cold hand of death itself. Something is not quite right here. The keep is within ten miles of the Desert of Skulls, there should not be snow here, and most certainly not a blizzard. Letting your over-active imagination rest for a while, and blaming the weather upon the wizards, you get into bed and attempt to settle, falling into a disturbed sleep, tired from your journey to the keep.

A single chime from the keep’s bell signals the start of a new and forlorn day… It is midnight. The sheets of snow continue to assail the ancient building, ricocheting off its sides like tiny slivers of glass. Far off into the distance, a lone man hobbles towards that place. Bent double over his oak walking stick, he strains his eyes in the darkness, his lantern useless in this weather. A few minutes later, he reaches the gate.

A loud voice rings out from the lantern light of the gatehouse, barely audible above the raging storm.

“Stop! In the name of the magical protectorate, who goes there?”

The old man looks towards the lantern light, and in a voice that sounds strained and lost, replies,

“I am in desperate need of shelter… will you please help me? All I ask is a bed for the night…”

There is a response from inside the gatehouse, mumbles, stifled complaint enquiring as to if the visitor is aware of what the hour is, as the locks click open with a loud, dull thunk and the man is ushered inside. Several silent minutes later, all that remains of the gatekeeper is a small pool of blood and powdered bone, blowing around the floor of the gatehouse in the wind.

Something silent moves down the corridor that connects the gatehouse to the castle interior. Systematically, it searches every room, one by one. It brushes past you in your sleep, seemingly through you…causing dark and terrible nightmares as it passes, and your sleep to be ever more restless.
Much later, the Something has found its way to the keep’s depths. Many floors below the surface, down a long corridor covered in runes, it stands before a huge oak and gold door, guarded by two guards, highly trained in the magical arts, alert and ready to repel attack.
The thing brushes past the first guard, still not visible, but leaving a feeling of dread and despair wherever it goes.
“Deran? Is that you?”
The first guard looks sideways, hearing a voice, seemingly from nowhere, whispering and muttering in the gloom. Before he knows what is happening, the Thing has sucked his soul into the realm of magic. The two seconds of distraction are all that is needed to achieve the task.
“Hey, pay attention! We are supposed to be watching…”
The second sentinel drops his guard for a fraction of a second to glance at the first guard. What he sees in the place of the guard fills him with dread and terror. Standing before him is a Thing, composed of shadows and darkness, almost humanoid in form, but translucent like black murky water. Thousands of impossibly white teeth jut from a mouth like ebony, set below two eyes, glowing red like the pits of hell themselves, swirling maelstroms of hate and suffering ready and hungry to devour. The guard has chance to utter the first split-second of a single, terrified horrific scream as a hundred scintillating tentacles emerge from the ravenous maw, pulling him face-first into the mouth of the Creature, and drain him of his very essence, and consuming in the most painful, terrible and horrific way for any mortal creature to end its life…
