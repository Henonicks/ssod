Valley City, cradled within the protective embrace of the safer passes of the Deathdrop Mountains, unfolds like a tapestry of resilience and ingenuity. The heart of the city beats to the rhythmic flow of the rushing River Larret, a lifeline that brings vitality and prosperity to its people.

At the core of Valley City's unique charm stands a majestic lighthouse, an engineering marvel that guides oarsman powered barges up the Larret to drive various industries. The creaking and turning of the lighthouse echoes through the stone walls, providing a constant hum that resonates with the city's industrious spirit.

The architecture of Valley City is a testament to the endurance of time. Long straight stone roads, masterfully crafted over centuries, carve strong patterns across the landscape. These hardy thoroughfares gracefully traverse the city, connecting the city's districts and providing breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.

The city is a harmonious blend of practicality and aesthetic beauty. Stone buildings with arched doorways and narrow windows line the riverbanks, while bustling marketplaces and workshops contribute to the vibrant tapestry of daily life. The scent of freshly baked bread mingles with the sound of artisans hammering metal, creating a sensory experience that defines the character of Valley City.

A huge wooden bridge arches gracefully over the Larret to the north, linking both sides of the river and fostering a sense of unity among its inhabitants. As daylight wanes, the glow of lanterns and the flicker of hearth fires cast warm hues on the stone facades, creating a cozy ambiance.

Valley City, with its resilient people and enduring infrastructure, stands as a beacon of stability in the shadow of the Deathdrop Mountains. The rushing waters of the Larret, harnessed by the iconic water wheel, symbolize the city's ability to thrive amid challenging terrain, making it a place where history, industry, and natural beauty converge.
