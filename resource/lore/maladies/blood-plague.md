Rapid deterioration of the blood vessels, causing internal bleeding, severe anemia, and organ failure. Darkened, almost black blood is a distinct characteristic.

## Causes:

## Treatments:
Magical healing spells focused on blood purification can slow the progression. Extracts from the Silvermoon flower, found in sacred gardens, have known to counteract the effects.
