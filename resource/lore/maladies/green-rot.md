## Symptoms:
Afflicted individuals experience a sickly green hue to their skin, accompanied by a gradual decay of flesh. Fatigue, weakness, and a general malaise are common.

## Causes:
Contracted through exposure to certain fungi found in the damp caverns and marshy areas. Spores released by the fungi are the primary mode of transmission.

## Treatments:
A skilled healer may use purification spells to cleanse the body of the fungal infection. Rare herbs found in mystical groves can be used in poultices to aid recovery.
