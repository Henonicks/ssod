In the vast expanse of Cryptillia's wilderness, woodsmen emerge as the consummate masters of the natural world. Trained in the intricate arts of infiltration, exploration, and scouting, they navigate the dense woodlands with a prowess that transcends the ordinary. Woodsmen are not only adept at traversing wooded realms but also possess a holistic understanding of survival in the untamed wilderness.

Their knowledge extends beyond mere navigation; woodsmen are proficient foragers, discerning which plants are sustenance and which conceal peril. With an acute sense of what to consume and what to avoid, they navigate the verdant landscapes with a keen eye for the bounty nature provides.

Efficiency defines a woodsman's approach to travel. Expert rationing of supplies and an innate understanding of the optimal times to journey through different environments characterize their pragmatic mindset. They conserve strength judiciously, anticipating the trials ahead and preparing for the challenges that await.

While possessing limited spellcasting abilities, woodsmen place a premium on their natural skills, relying on their inherent stealthiness and a tactile comprehension of tactics. Preferring the tangible and the physical over abstract magical theories, they navigate the world through a combination of innate instincts and learned expertise.

In the wild expanses of Cryptillia, woodsmen embody a harmonious blend of nature and skill. Their affinity for the wilderness, coupled with practical knowledge, makes them invaluable scouts and explorers. As they thread through the tangled undergrowth and vast landscapes, woodsmen weave a narrative of resilience and adaptability, a testament to their mastery over the untamed domains of Cryptillia.

**Woodsmen gain an advantage when hunting, and are much more likely to successfully hunt in the wilderness than other professions.**
