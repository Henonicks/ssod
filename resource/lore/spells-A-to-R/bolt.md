Spell: Bolt

A manifestation of destructive might, the bolt spell propels a searing, superheated plasma bolt from the caster's fingertips. While distinct in its effects, this arcane discharge earns its moniker as the "little brother" to the thunderbolt spell, wielding formidable power and formidable details that distinguish it in the realm of magical projectiles.
