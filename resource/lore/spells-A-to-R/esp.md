## Spell: E.S.P.

E.S.P., a conduit to the recesses of the mind, allows a caster to delve into thoughts, implanting illusions that steer enemies towards self-inflicted harm or unintended benefits. Its potency, akin to hypnotism, finds its realm outside the chaos of combat. Exploiting the vulnerabilities of an unfocused and weak mind, E.S.P. manifests strategic advantages in subtler engagements, strategic manipulations, and the subtle dance of wits. In the hands of a sagacious spellcaster, E.S.P. reveals the intricate tapestry of intentions, transforming the battlefield into a stage of mental chess.
