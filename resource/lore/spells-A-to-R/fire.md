## Spell: Fire

The fire spell, a dance of controlled flames upon the caster's fingertips, transforms seasoned users into wielders of fiery might. Masters can unleash it akin to a flamethrower, turning the element into a fearsome weapon against adversaries or a comforting source of warmth, a beacon in the cold.
