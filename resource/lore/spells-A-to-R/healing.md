## Spell: Healing

The Healing spell, a benevolent invocation in the sorcerer's arsenal, bestows a boon of vitality upon living entities, replenishing ten stamina points. An essential facet of the caster's benevolence is that this mystical mend cannot extend to the undead or demonic creatures, acknowledging the inherent boundaries of life forces. However, the sorcerer's altruism comes with constraints; they are precluded from self-application, and the spell's formidable efficacy requires a considerable investment of time, limiting its frequency to once per day.
