## Spell: Invisible

The Invisible spell, a shroud woven from the fabric of the unseen, veils the caster and their immediate surroundings in imperceptibility. Vanishing from the visible spectrum, invisible enemies become elusive targets, evading conventional attacks with elusive finesse. In combat, this spell serves as a potent catalyst for inflicting significant damage, providing the caster a tactical advantage that leaves adversaries guessing and vulnerable to unseen assaults. The arcane mastery of invisibility, however, demands strategic finesse, as even the hidden can become ensnared in the tangled threads of magic.
