## Spell: Light

A radiant aura materializes above the caster's head with the light spell, casting brilliance rivaling any lantern. This enchanted illumination defies extinguishing unless the caster succumbs to defeat or intentionally withdraws the spell, providing a constant source of radiant radiance in the darkest of realms.
