## Spell: Steal

The Steal spell, a fleeting invocation of larceny, empowers the caster to double their sneak score for a brief period. The spell's effects persist for a single game paragraph, followed by a mandatory cooldown of ten paragraphs due to its intricate and time-consuming nature. While adept at facilitating stealth, its application in combat is impractical, given the spell's protracted casting duration.
