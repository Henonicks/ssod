## Spell: Strength

The strength spell, a fleeting surge of unnatural might, empowers the caster with inhuman strength for a mere fraction of time. Typically harnessed in the briefest of intervals, it grants the caster the ability to unleash a devastating blow upon an adversary, sending them reeling from the overwhelming force.
