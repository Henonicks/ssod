## Spell: Water

With a mere gesture, the water spell conjures forth a surging torrent from any part of the caster's form, often favoring the palms or even the eyes for dramatic flair. This aquatic force becomes a versatile tool, compelling foes into disadvantageous positions or ensuring survival in dire circumstances, such as traversing a desert wasteland.
